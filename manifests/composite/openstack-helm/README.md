# OpenStack-Helm Composite

The OpenStack-Helm composite provides a releasable collection of documents that
enable deployment of OpenStack-Helm using the [Helm
Operator](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator) and
[Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize).

The OpenStack-Helm composite can also be used as a Kustomize entrypoint for the
[Airship project](https://airshipit.org), enabling operators to deploy
OpenStack-Helm using [airshipctl](https://opendev.org/airship/airshipctl).
